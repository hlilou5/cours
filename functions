We're going to need functions in our app, and declaring them is very easy. There's 2 ways: inside render and outside of it.
1- Inside : we declare them like any ES6 function with const then we call it by name.
2- outside : we declare them without const but we need to add "this." before its name. 
For example to make the check a function, we do the following: 

//First method :inside
class Student extends Component{
	render() {
		const check = () => {
			if(this.props.name==="eminem"){ return 0; }
			else{ return 600; }}
		let price = check();
		return(/*JSX*/ );
}}
//Second method :outside
class Student extends Component{
	const check = () => {
			if(this.props.name==="eminem"){ return 0; }
			else{ return 600; }}
	render() {
		let price = this.check();
		return(/*JSX*/ );
}}
